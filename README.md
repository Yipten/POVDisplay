# POVDisplay

Code for a persistence of vision display utilizing five LEDs driven by an Arduino Nano. 

The string of characters in "text[]" will be displayed, as long as it isn't too long. There must be enough empty space in a revolution to allow for a slight error in timing. 

Supported characters are ASCII values 32 through 90 (spaces, common special characters, numbers, and capital letters).
